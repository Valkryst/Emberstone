Emberstone is a long-running side project of mine. It was originally conceived of and written for University course on
game development. Since then I have slowly worked on it here-and-there in the hopes of one day rewriting and expanding
on the original game which was hastily written over the span of a few weeks.

See the `archived-master-2023-10-17` branch for the original code.
